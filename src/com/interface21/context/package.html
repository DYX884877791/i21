<body>This package builds on the com.interface21.beans package toadd support for the Observer design pattern and the ability
for application objects to share data objects and obtain
resources using a consistent API.

<br>
There is no necessity for Spring applications to depend
on ApplicationContext, or even BeanFactory, functionality,
explicitly. One of the strengths of the Spring architecture
is that application objects can often be configured without
any dependency on Spring-specific APIs.
