/**
 * Interface to be implemented by objects that define a mapping between
 * requests and handler objects.
 *
 * <p>This class can be implemented by application developers,
 * although this is not necessary, as the default BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping
 * is available if no custom handlers are registered.
 *
 * <p>The ability to parameterize this mapping is a powerful and unusual
 * capability of this MVC framework. For example, it is possible to write
 * a custom mapping based on session state, cookie state or many other
 * variables. No other MVC framework seems to be equally flexible.
 *
 * <p>Note: Implementations can implement the Ordered interface to be able to
 * specify a sorting order and thus a priority for getting applied by
 * ControllerServlet. Non-Ordered instances get treated as lowest priority.
