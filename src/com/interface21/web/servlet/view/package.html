Superclass for application-specific View implementations,
and standard views.

<br>Application developers don't usually need to implement views,
as the framework provides standard views for JSPs, servlets,
Velocity, WebMacro, etc. However, the ability to implement
custom views easily by subclassing the AbstractView
class in this package can be very helpful if an application
has unusual view requirements.
