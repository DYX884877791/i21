Lower-level of JDBC abstraction, as discussed in Chapter 9 of<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1861007841/">Expert One-On-One J2EE Design and Development</a>by Rod Johnson (Wrox, 2002).<br>The classes in this package make JDBC easier to use andreduce the likelihood of common errors. In particular,they:<ul><li>Simplify error handling, avoiding the need for try/catch/finalblocks in application code.<li>Present exceptions to application code in a generic hierarchy of unchecked exceptions,enabling applications to catch data access exceptions without being dependenton JDBC, and to ignore fatal exceptions there is no value in catching.<li>Allow the implementation of error handling to be modifiedto target different RDBMSs without introducing proprietarydependencies into application code.</ul>
