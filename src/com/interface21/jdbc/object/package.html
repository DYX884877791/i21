Higher level of JDBC abstraction, as discussed in Chapter 9 of<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1861007841/">Expert One-On-One J2EE Design and Development</a>by Rod Johnson (Wrox, 2002).<br>The classes in this package represent RDBMSqueries, updates and stored procedures asthreadsafe, reusable objects. This approach is modelled byJDO, although of course objects returned by queries are"disconnected" from the database.<br>This class depends on the lower-level abstraction inthe com.interface21.jdbc.core package. Exceptions thrownare as in the com.interface21.dao package, meaning thatcode using this package does not need to implementJDBC or RDBMS-specific error handling.
