This package contains classes that allow easy access to EJBs.
In particular, the classes in this package allow 
transparent access to stateless session beans (SLSBs)
with local interfaces, avoiding the need for application
code using them to use EJB-specific APIs and JNDI lookups,
and work with business interfaces that could be implemented
without using EJB. This provides a valuable decoupling
of client (such as web components) and business objects
(which may or may not be EJBs). This gives us the choice
of introducing EJB into an application without affecting
code using business objects.

<p>The classes in this package are discussed
in Chapter 11 of
