/**
 * Convenient superclass for stateless session beans (SLSBs), minimizing the work
 * involved in implementing an SLSB and preventing common errors. <b>Note that
 * SLSBs are the most useful kind of EJB.</b>
 * <br>As the ejbActivate() and ejbPassivate() methods cannot be invoked on SLSBs,
 * these methods are implemented to throw an exception and should not be overriden by 
 * subclasses. (Unfortunately the EJB specification forbids enforcing this by making
 * EJB lifecycle methods final.)
 * <br>There should
 * be no need to override the setSessionContext() or
 * ejbCreate() lifecycle methods.
 * <br>Subclasses are left to implement the onEjbCreate() method to do
 * whatever initialization they wish to do after their BeanFactory
 * has already been loaded, and is available from the getBeanFactory() method.
 * This class provides the no-argument ejbCreate() method required
 * by the EJB specification, but not the SessionBean interface,
 * eliminating a common cause of EJB deployment failure.
