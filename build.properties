# Ant properties for building Spring framework
# Authors: Dmitriy Kopylenko, Rod Johnson


# ===========================================================
# Change these absolute path settings to match OS and file paths
# if using this build script in isolation.
# Can be overridden from settings in calling scripts
# ===========================================================

# Home directory of J2EE 1.3 or 1.4 Reference Implementation
# This will follow your operating system's conventions for absolute paths:
# e.g. /home/rod/j2sdkee1.3.1 on Unix or Linux.
# Alternatively, dispense with this property and set the j2ee.jar file property
# below to a Jar containing all J2EE classes
j2ee.dir=c:/j2sdkee1.3.1

# End absolute path settings
