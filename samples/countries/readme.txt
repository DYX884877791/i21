This directory contains the web app source.
For deployment, it needs to be built with Apache Ant.
The only requirements are JDK >=1.3 and Ant >=1.5.

Run "ant" in this directory for available targets
(e.g. "ant build", "ant warfile"). Note that to start
Ant this way, you'll need an XML parser in your
classpath (e.g. jre/lib/ext; included in JDK 1.4).
You can also invoke Ant manually, in this directory.
