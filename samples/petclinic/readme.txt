This directory contains the web app source.
For deployment, it needs to be built with Apache Ant.
The only requirements are JDK >=1.3 and Ant >=1.5.

Run "ant" in this directory for available targets
(e.g. "ant build", "ant warfile").

Note that to be able to execute the web app with its
default settings, you'll need to start the HSQLDB
instance in db/hsqldb first, using server.bat.
